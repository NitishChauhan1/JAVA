/*
 * üß† Java Class and Object Basics ‚Äì Short Theory
Class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines variables (attributes) and methods (functions).

Object is an instance of a class. Each object has its own copy of the class's variables.

Constructor is a special method used to initialize objects when they are created.

Instance Variables (like name, age) belong to each object and store its data.

Methods (like displayInfo()) can access and use the object's data to perform actions (e.g., print details).

üîÅ Example Flow:
Class Person defines name, age, and a method displayInfo().

Constructor sets name and age when object is created.

displayInfo() prints the values of that specific object's name and age.
